    st.markdown("""
    Imagine a great warrior-prince in the midst of the epic Kurukshetra war. The world around him is a storm of chaos‚Äîa swirling, twisting battlefield. Chariots clash, arrows fly, and the very ground seems to warp and shift with the strategies of the opposing army. This battlefield is our **linear transformation**‚Äîa force that changes the position of every warrior, every rock, and every grain of dust.

    The prince, however, is bound by his **Dharma**. His Dharma is not a physical location, but a sacred duty, an intrinsic path or principle that he must follow. No matter how the battlefield shifts, his core purpose remains steadfast.

    - If the army charges east (a 'shear' transformation), knocking everyone sideways, the prince, following his Dharma, might move forward along his designated path, but he does so without deviating from his core direction.
    - If the enemy lines expand (a 'scale' transformation), pushing everything outwards, his path remains true, though he may find himself covering more ground, his influence magnified.

    In this storm of transformation, most vectors (representing the paths of ordinary soldiers) are knocked off their original course. They point in new, unexpected directions after the transformation is applied. But there exists a special, almost magical direction‚Äîthe prince's path of Dharma.

    This path is the **Eigenvector**.
    
    When the transformation of the battlefield acts on the prince who is on this path, his direction does not change. He stays true to his line. He might be pushed further down that path (stretched) or find his advance shortened (shrunk), but his direction is unaltered. The amount by which he is stretched or shrunk is his **Eigenvalue**. It is the measure of the transformation's impact *along* his sacred path.

    So, an Eigenvector is a special direction in space that is left unchanged by a transformation. An Eigenvalue is the scalar factor by which that vector is stretched or shrunk. Our mission in this chapter is not merely to find a mathematical curiosity, but to find the very soul of a transformation‚Äîits inherent, unchanging paths of Dharma.

    Our intuition is strong. We feel what an Eigenvector is. Now, let us give it a formal mathematical name and learn its laws, its *dharma* in the world of *Ganita* (mathematics).

    The entire concept is captured in one profound equation:
    """)

    st.markdown("""
    Where:
    - **T** is the transformation matrix (the battlefield's rules).
    - **v** is the Eigenvector (the path of Dharma).
    - **Œª** (lambda) is the Eigenvalue (the scalar impact factor).

    This equation states that applying the transformation **T** to the vector **v** results in the *exact same vector*, just scaled by a number **Œª**.

    ### How do we find these sacred paths?

    We can't just guess and check forever. We need a system. Let's rearrange the equation.
    
    1.  Start with the core equation: `T*v = Œª*v`
    2.  Bring everything to one side: `T*v - Œª*v = 0`
    3.  To subtract these terms, we must express `Œª*v` as a matrix-vector product. We use the Identity matrix `I`: `Œª*I*v = Œª*v`.
    4.  Substitute it back: `T*v - Œª*I*v = 0`
    5.  Factor out the vector `v`: `(T - ŒªI)v = 0`

    This final equation is the key! It says that there is some matrix `(T - ŒªI)` which, when applied to our special vector `v`, crushes it to the zero vector. For this to happen with a non-zero vector `v`, the matrix `(T - ŒªI)` must be "collapsible". In linear algebra, this means its **determinant must be zero**.

    `det(T - ŒªI) = 0`

    Solving this equation for `Œª` gives us the Eigenvalues! Once we have the Eigenvalues, we can plug them back into `(T - ŒªI)v = 0` to find the corresponding Eigenvectors `v`.

    We have found the path of Dharma. We have seen that within every transformation, there are fundamental, unshakable directions. This is not just a mathematical party trick; it is one of the most profound concepts in applied mathematics.

    Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues are the **soul of a matrix**. They reveal its fundamental properties and behavior.

    - **In Engineering (Civil & Mechanical):** When building a bridge in Mumbai or a new aircraft for the IAF, engineers use Eigenvalue analysis to find the natural frequencies of vibration. If an external force matches these frequencies, the structure can resonate and collapse. Finding the Eigenvalues means finding and avoiding catastrophe.
    
    - **In Data Science (The heart of Bengaluru's Tech Scene):** The most powerful dimensionality reduction technique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), is nothing but finding the Eigenvectors of a dataset's covariance matrix. These Eigenvectors are the "principal components"‚Äîthe directions of greatest variance. It's how we find the most important patterns in massive datasets, from customer behavior to financial markets. It finds the "Dharma of the Data".

    - **In Quantum Mechanics:** The entire universe at its most fundamental level is described by Eigenvalues. The Schr√∂dinger equation is an Eigenvalue equation. Its Eigenvectors are the quantum states (like orbitals of an electron), and its Eigenvalues are the observable, quantized energy levels.

    The key takeaway is this: **Eigenvectors reveal the stable, intrinsic properties of any linear system, while Eigenvalues tell you the magnitude of the effect along those stable lines.**

    We have learned to see the hidden paths that give a transformation its character. But there's another, more fundamental property we must understand. Beyond how a matrix stretches specific vectors, how does it stretch or shrink *space itself*? What is the total impact of the transformation on area or volume? To understand that, we must venture forward and uncover the secret of the **Determinant**.
