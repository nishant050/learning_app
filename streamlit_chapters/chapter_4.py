    My dear apprentice, you have learned to gather the finest materials. You can carve beautiful text, you can display shimmering tables of data, and you can even craft interactive widgets that respond to a user's touch. But materials alone do not make a palace. A pile of marble is not the Taj Mahal. A stack of bricks is not a grand Haveli.

    Today, we move from being a craftsman to being an architect‚Äîa *Sthapati*. We learn the divine art of arranging space. An application, like a palace, must have structure. It must have public courtyards and private chambers, grand halls and hidden alcoves. This structure is what separates a simple script from a professional, intuitive application. It guides the visitor, tells them where to look, and creates a sense of order and purpose.

    Our guiding philosophy will be the design of a magnificent Rajasthani Haveli. Think of its sprawling structure. It isn't a single, long corridor. It has a grand entrance, leading to a central courtyard open to the sky, where many activities happen side-by-side. From this courtyard, you can enter different wings of the palace, each dedicated to a specific purpose‚Äîthe Hall of Public Audience, the private quarters, the library. And within these rooms, you might find ornate chests that hold precious jewels, revealed only when you open them.

    This is the soul of app design. Our Streamlit commands for layout are the architectural blueprints for our own digital Haveli.
    - **`st.columns`** are our open-air **Courtyards**, allowing us to place elements side-by-side.
    - **`st.tabs`** are the different **Wings of the Palace**, letting users navigate between distinct sections without leaving the page.
    - **`st.expander`** is the ornate **Treasure Chest**, keeping detailed information neatly tucked away until the user wishes to see it.
    - **`st.container`** is the invisible **Foundation** or platform upon which a room is built, grouping elements together logically.

    Before we lay our first digital brick, let us visualize the inspiration for our work.

This is essential for building complex layouts where you might want a summary at the top that is populated by calculations that happen later.

    Our intuition is strong. We feel the flow of the Haveli. Now, let us learn the precise incantations‚Äîthe formal syntax‚Äîthat give our architectural visions form. This is our *Shilpa Shastra*, the sacred text on the science of building. Every parameter has a purpose.

    ### 1. `st.columns(spec, *, gap="small")`
    This is the command to create our side-by-side courtyards.

    - **`spec`**: This is the most important parameter. It defines the number of columns and their relative widths.
        - **Integer:** `st.columns(3)` creates three columns of equal width.
        - **List of Numbers (int or float):** `st.columns([2, 1, 1])` creates three columns. The first is twice as wide as the second and third. This is perfect for layouts with a main content area and two smaller sidebars. The numbers represent weights or ratios. `[0.5, 0.25, 0.25]` would produce the same result.
    - **`gap`**: An optional string that sets the size of the gap between columns. It can be `"small"`, `"medium"`, or `"large"`. This controls the "breathing room" in your app.

    **Code Deep Dive:**
    ```python
    # Two columns, the first being 3 times wider than the second
    col1, col2 = st.columns(, gap="large")

    with col1:
        st.header("Main Content Area")
        st.write("Because we used `[3, 1]`, this column gets 75% of the space.")
    
    with col2:
        st.header("Sidebar")
        st.write("This column gets the remaining 25% of the space.")
    ```

    ### 2. `st.tabs(list_of_strings)`
    This command creates the different wings of our palace.

    - **`list_of_strings`**: You must pass a list where each string is the label for one tab. The command returns a list of tab objects, one for each string you provided.
    - **Usage:** You must use a `with` statement to tell Streamlit which elements belong to which tab object.

    **Code Deep Dive:**
    ```python
    # Define the labels for your tabs
    tab_labels = ["Data Source", "Data Visualization", "ML Model Insights"]
    
    # Create the tab objects
    tab1, tab2, tab3 = st.tabs(tab_labels)

    with tab1:
        st.header("Data Source Details")
        st.write("Place your dataframe and data loading info here.")

    with tab2:
        st.header("Interactive Visualizations")
        st.write("Place your `st.pyplot` or `st.plotly_chart` calls here.")

    with tab3:
        st.header("Machine Learning Model Insights")
        st.write("Show model accuracy, feature importance, etc., here.")
    ```

    ### 3. `st.expander(label, expanded=False)`
    The command to create our treasure chests.

    - **`label`**: The string that will be visible on the expander when it is collapsed. It should invite the user to click.
    - **`expanded`**: An optional boolean. If `True`, the expander will be open by default when the app loads. If `False` (the default), it will be closed.

    **Code Deep Dive:**
    ```python
    st.write("Here is a summary of our project.")

    # The expander is closed by default
    with st.expander("See the full project methodology..."):
        st.write("This section was hidden.")
        st.write("It's a great place for verbose logs, detailed data dictionaries, or lengthy explanations that not every user needs to see immediately.")

    # This expander will be open when the page loads
    with st.expander("Credits and Acknowledgements", expanded=True):
        st.write("This project was made possible by...")
    ```

    ### 4. `st.container()`
    The command to lay our invisible foundation.

    - It takes no parameters. It simply creates a container object.
    - Its power comes from how it's used with a `with` statement to group elements, or by assigning it to a variable to insert elements out of order.

    **Code Deep Dive (Out-of-Order Rendering):**
    ```python
    # 1. Create a container variable at the top
    summary_container = st.container()

    st.write("This part of the app runs first.")
    # ... more code and calculations ...
    value_from_calculation = 10 * 5

    # 2. Now, use the container variable to add content back at the top!

This hidden section should only be visible if the spymaster knows where to click.

    You have done it, architect. You have moved beyond laying single bricks and have now designed the very structure of the palace. This skill is the dividing line between a simple script and a sophisticated application.

    **Where This Power is Used:**
    - **Financial Dashboards:** Every stock trading app uses columns to show charts, news, and buy/sell orders on one screen.
    - **Data Science in Bengaluru:** A data scientist presents their findings to a client using tabs for "Data Exploration," "Model Performance," and "Business Impact."
    - **E-commerce Websites:** Product pages use expanders for "Product Details," "Specifications," and "Customer Reviews" to keep the main page clean.
    - **Internal Business Tools:** Companies build apps to track inventory, where different warehouses or product categories are separated into tabs.

    **The Key Takeaway:** The "Dharma" of this lesson is that **structure serves the user.** A well-organized app is an act of respect for the user's time and attention. Your goal is not to show everything at once, but to guide them to what they need, when they need it.

    You have built a beautiful, static palace. It is perfectly organized and a marvel to behold. But it is lifeless. It treats every visitor exactly the same. What if the palace could recognize you? What if it could remember what you were doing the last time you visited? What if it could change and adapt based on your choices?

    To do this, our palace needs a memory. It needs a soul. In our next chapter, we will bestow this gift upon it. We will learn about **Session State**, the magic that turns a static structure into a living, breathing, interactive experience.

            "answer": "The different wings of the palace (e.g., library, armory)",
            "explanation": "Correct! `st.tabs` is used to create distinct, self-contained sections that the user can navigate between, just like the different wings of a large palace."
        },
        "2. How do you create two columns where the first is twice as wide as the second?": {
            "options": ["`st.columns(2, 1)`", "`st.columns([2, 1])`", "`st.columns(width=[2, 1])`", "`st.columns('2:1')`"],
            "answer": "`st.columns([2, 1])`",
            "explanation": "Excellent. The widths are defined by passing a list of numbers (integers or floats) representing the ratio of sizes."

            "answer": "`st.expander`",
            "explanation": "Precisely! `st.expander` is designed for this exact purpose‚Äîkeeping detailed or non-essential information neatly tucked away until it's requested."
        },
        "4. What is the unique primary advantage of using `st.container`?": {
            "options": ["It adds a visible border around elements.", "It automatically creates columns.", "It allows you to insert elements into a specific spot on the page, even if your code for them appears later in the script.", "It is required for using `st.tabs`."],
            "answer": "It allows you to insert elements into a specific spot on the page, even if your code for them appears later in the script.",
            "explanation": "That's the key insight! While it also groups elements, its true power lies in enabling out-of-order or delayed rendering, which is crucial for complex app layouts."
        },
        "5. You want to make an `st.expander` visible as soon as the page loads. What parameter do you use?": {

            "answer": "`st.expander('Label', expanded=True)`",
